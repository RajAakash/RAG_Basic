## pypdf

-connect python with pdf

## Files:

- basic_app.py: Has flask implementation basic
- document_processor.py : Has basic document storing and processing using PyPDFLoader and langchain
- vector-store.py: Has basic chroma db use to store embeddings and calculate similarity of embeddings to answer our question from pdf
